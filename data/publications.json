      "abstract": "We show that the computations of relaxation rate is solution are highly sensitive to the choice of representation of the environmental spectral density (SD). The key reason is that electronic relaxation is dominated by the resonant contribution from the high-frequency tails of the SD, which can vary significantly between strategies.",
