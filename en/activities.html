						<h2 id="act0">How can I Help Ukraine?</h2>
						<p>On February 24th at 4 AM Kyiv time Russia
							has shelled all major cities in Ukraine.
							This brutal and unprovoked attack has already
							cost thousands of civilian lives and led to 
							millions of people fleeing war, not to mention
							thousands of military casualties on both sides.
							You can learn more about this war 
							<a href="https://war.ukraine.ua/">on Ukraine's official web-site</a>.

				<!--Currently I am a High School Science and Chemistry teacher at the <a href="https://edu.victoriaballet.ca/">Arts and Sciences Academy of Canada</a>.-->
				Since 2021 I am coordinating a partnership between <a href="https://novaukraine.org/">NovaUkraine</a> nonprofit in the US 
				and <a href="https://teachforall.org/network-partners#27416">Teach for Ukraine</a> nonprofit in Ukraine, being actively involved in both organizations.

				At Caltech, Tom Miller, Jeff Mendez and I designed a computational
				component of the freshman laboratory chemistry course, <a href="https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/courses/department/Ch">Ch3</a> based on 
				<a href="https://www.entos.ai/envision">Envision</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
				I tutored chemistry, physics and math to high school students throughout my Undergrad. Many
				of them are currently studying in their dream schools: University college in UK, Columbia
				University in USA, University of Toronto in Canada. I also trained several Olympiad
				participants: Kozibroda Bohdan (bronze for Ukraine, 
				<a href="http://www.icho2016.chemistry.ge/medals.php">IChO-2016</a>) and team Canada for 
				<a href="https://50icho.eu">IChO-2018</a> (2 bronze and 1 silver medals). During the Covid-19 pandemic I
				was doing <a href="https://causetutoring.org/online-extra-help-sessions-during-covid-19/">Zoom science tutoring for high school students</a> 
				on behalf of the <a href="https://causetutoring.org/">CAUSE tutoring</a> nonprofit.

						<p>I listen to all kinds of rock music, and I always have a pair of wireless headphones on me.
							Many people guess these are for listening to music 24/7. And they are wrong! These are
							mostly so I can listen to audio-books every time I am bored.
							<br>Nonetheless, I do enjoy good music, just not as a constant background and I went to the
							live shows of <a href="https://www.metallica.com">Metallica</a>, <a

							<p>I used to read a lot of books when I was a kid, by which I mean over 80 of them a year.
								As I got busier, I read less and less fiction and more science textbooks. Nowadays I
								almost never read non-science, but I miss it a lot. I use audiobooks as an effective
								remedy, managing to squeeze in a few hours of listening a day, while performing routine
